intraspecies-cooperation
=======================
An agent-based model designed to investigate the evolution of intraspecies cooperation, written in Python.  Seeks to optimize a feed-forward neural network selected for by a simplistic genetic algorithm.

Users with [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) installed may run `gfx_driver.py` to watch the simulation in real-time -- otherwise, `console_driver.py` will run the same model but without the graphical display.
